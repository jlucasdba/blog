So this is an experiment. I've never tried to do a blog before, and we're going to see how it goes.

I've worked in tech a lot of years now. Every so often you come across an interesting problem or learn something new, and I've often thought it would be nice to have a place to write it up and share it with others. So that's what I aim for this page to be. I can't promise I'll update often, or that anyone else will find the content interesting. But if I write it up, I can promise it'll be something **I** found interesting. Maybe you will too.

My primary trade is as a database admin, so you can expect a lot of Postgres, and maybe some Oracle. I also write a lot of Python, so probably some of that as well. And after that we'll see.

Welcome aboard.
