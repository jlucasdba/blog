My name is James Lucas. I'm a database admin with 15+ years of experience; mostly in Oracle and PostgreSQL, along with some MySQL, MongoDB, and SQL Server work here and there. Other areas of professional interest are Linux system administration and tool development. The last few years I've been doing a lot of development work in Python, but I have a lot of experience with Bash and Perl as well. I'm also at least passably conversant in C, Java, and Go. Recently I've been doing a lot of automation work with Ansible.
