I'm a database admin with 15+ years of experience - mostly in Oracle and PostgreSQL. I've also done some MySQL, MongoDB, and SQL Server work here and there. I've done a fair amount of development work on internal scripts and tools. The last few years I've been doing a lot of that work in Python, but I have quite a bit of experience with Bash and Perl as well. Recently I've been doing a lot of automation work with Ansible.
